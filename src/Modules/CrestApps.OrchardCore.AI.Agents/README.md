## AI Agents Feature

The **AI Agents** feature extends the functionality of the **AI Services** feature by enabling intelligent agents to perform tasks on your Orchard Core site.

### Getting Started

1. **Install the Package**  
   Add the `CrestApps.OrchardCore.AI.Agents` package to your startup web project.

2. **Enable the Feature**  
   In the **Orchard Core Admin**, go to the Features section and enable **AI Agents**.

### Configuring AI Agents

Once the feature is enabled:

- Navigate to your AI Profiles.
- Create a new profile or edit an existing one.
- Under the **Capabilities** tab, assign the capabilities you want the AI Agent to perform.

This allows you to tailor each agentâ€™s abilities to suit your specific site tasks and workflows.
