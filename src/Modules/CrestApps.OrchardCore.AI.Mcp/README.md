# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is an open protocol that enables seamless integration between LLM applications and external data sources and tools. Whether you're building an AI-powered IDE, enhancing a chat interface, or creating custom AI workflows, MCP provides a standardized way to connect LLMs with the context they need.

## Model Context Protocol (Local MCP) Client Feature

The **Model Context Protocol (Local MCP) Client** allows your application to connect to locally running MCP servers, enabling seamless integration with AI profiles.

### Example Use Case: Time Zone AI Model

Let's say you want to equip your AI model with the ability to provide time zone information for any location in the world. The `mcp/time` Docker image is built for this purpose.

Follow the steps below to set up the MCP server locally and connect to it using a Windows PC.

---

### Step 1: Install Docker Desktop

Download and install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/). Once installed, launch Docker Desktop.

---

### Step 2: Pull the MCP Docker Image

1. In Docker Desktop, navigate to the **Docker Hub** tab.
2. Search for `mcp/time`.
3. Click on the image and then click the **Pull** button to install the Docker container locally.

### Step 3: Connect the Docker Image to Orchard Core

1. Open your Orchard Core project.
2. Go to **Artificial Intelligence** â†’ **MCP Connections**.
3. Click the **Add Connection** button.
4. Under the **Standard Input/Output** source, click **Add**.

Now fill in the connection details:

- **Display text**: A user-friendly name, e.g., `Global Time Capabilities`.
- **Command**: `docker`
- **Command arguments**:  
  ```json
  ["run", "-i", "--rm", "mcp/time"]
  ```

> These arguments come from the usage instructions on the [Docker Hub page for `mcp/time`](https://hub.docker.com/r/mcp/time).

---

### Step 4: Create an AI Profile

Create a new AI Profile and select the **Global Time Capabilities** connection you just configured.
