Use natural language to run tasks, manage content, interact with OrchardCore features, and do much more with integrated AI-powered tools.

## Overview

The **Orchard Core AI Agent** feature extends the **AI Services** feature by enabling intelligent agents that can perform tasks on your Orchard Core site using natural language. Agents leverage registered AI tools and capabilities to manage content, query data, interact with workflows, and automate common site administration tasks — all through conversational AI.

### Getting Started

1. **Install the Package**  
   Add the `CrestApps.OrchardCore.AI.Agent` package to your startup web project.

2. **Enable the Feature**  
   In the **Orchard Core Admin**, go to the Features section and enable **Orchard Core AI Agent**.

### Configuring AI Agents

Once the feature is enabled:

- Navigate to your AI Profiles.
- Create a new profile or edit an existing one.
- Under the **Capabilities** tab, assign the capabilities you want the AI Agent to perform.

This allows you to tailor each agent's abilities to suit your specific site tasks and workflows.
