| **Feature Name** | CrestApps Users Core |
| **Feature ID** | `CrestApps.OrchardCore.Users` |

Extends the Orchard Core Users module by adding functionality to cache users.

> **Note:** This feature is enabled by dependency only.

## User Display Name

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Feature Name** | User Display Name |
| **Feature ID** | `CrestApps.OrchardCore.Users.DisplayName` |

Provides a way to display a user's display name.

To set the display name format, navigate to **Settings** → **User Display Name**.

If you want to display the user display name in your project via code, you may do so by using the `IDisplayNameProvider` interface.

### Liquid Support

When the "Liquid" feature is enabled, a new helper to display the user's display name will become available (i.e, `display_name`). Here is an example:

```
{{ Model.User | display_name }}
```

### Enhanced User Search

When both the `Users` and `User Display Name` features are enabled, the search functionality within the Users UI will expand to include fields such as display name, first name, middle name, or last name in the search results.

Additionally, when the `UserPickerField` field is used, the display text will show the display name.

### Re-indexing Users

A recipe step is available to re-index users. This step will update all enabled users by default using a batch size of 250. To re-index all of your users run the following recipe:

```json
{
  "steps": [
    {
        "name": "indexUsers",
        "includeDisabledUsers": false,
        "batchSize": 250
    }
  ]
}
```

The `includeDisabledUsers` parameter within the `indexUsers` step is optional and allows for the indexing of disabled users if desired. Moreover, the `batchSize` parameter provides the ability to adjust the update batch size. The default value is set at 250 and can be increased to 1000 if necessary.

## User Avatar

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Feature Name** | User Avatar |
| **Feature ID** | `CrestApps.OrchardCore.Users.Avatars` |

Provides a way to display a user's avatar.

To change the default settings, navigate to **Settings** → **User Avatars**.
