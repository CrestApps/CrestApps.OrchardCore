Provides shared resources and libraries used by various CrestApps modules.

## Overview

This module provides shared frontend resources (CSS and JavaScript) that are used by other CrestApps modules. It acts as a central resource library, ensuring consistent styling and behavior across the CrestApps module ecosystem.

Other CrestApps modules declare a dependency on this feature to leverage common scripts and stylesheets without duplicating assets.
